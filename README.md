# jekyll-remote-include

A Liquid tag plugin for Jekyll that allows remote includes from external sources.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
group :jekyll_plugins do
    gem 'jekyll-remote-include', "~> 1.1.4", github: 'ianjevans/jekyll-remote-include'
end
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install jekyll-remote-include

Then add the following to your site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
plugins:
  - jekyll-remote-include
```

ðŸ’¡ If you are using a Jekyll version less than 3.5.0, use the `gems` key instead of `plugins`.

## Usage

The tag can be used to include the entire contents of a file, or just the content between begin and end tokens, in your Jekyll pages, posts and collections. The remote content is [cached](https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/cache-api/) to improve build times.

To include the entire file:

```liquid
{% remote_include https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jekyll/jekyll/master/README.markdown %}
```

To include only a portion of the file, specify the begin and end tokens separated by the pipe (|) character:

```liquid
{% remote_include https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jekyll/jekyll/master/README.markdown|begin_token|end_token %}
```

The `on_token_error` configuration option handles scenarios where the linked file doesn't contain the begin or end tokens. The build log will include information about which file contains the token error and whether the begin or end token is missing.

Set `on_token_error` to `fail` (the default) to stop the build with a failure if the begin or end token doesn't exist in the target file.

Set `on_token_error` to `full` if you want to include the entire remote file if there are token errors.

Set `on_token_error` to `none` if you want no content from the `remote_include`.

To use `on_token_error` add a `remote_include` section to your site's `_config.yml` and set `on_token_error`.

```yaml
remote_include:
  on_token_error: full
```
